Object Assembler is a free addon for Blender to quickly and easily assemble
predefined models with automatic alignment. Those models may consist of meshes,
materials, lamps, actions, text, lattices, armatures, empties, speakers or force
fields. You can create your own models or download fully modelled, cycles-ready
models from the model library.
